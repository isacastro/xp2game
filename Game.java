     *  "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users 
     *  can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended 
     *  to make it more interesting!
     * 
     *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
     *  method.
     * 
     *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
     *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
     *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
